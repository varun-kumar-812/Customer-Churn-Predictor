    "3. The F1 score for people who will churn(1) is also higher than the other models.(Data related to 1 is less than 0.Thus, this indicates that Xgboost was able to perform precision and recall(senstivity) better with limited data)."

    "3. People with longer contracts are less likely to churn. So, push for longer contracts.\n",
